# Release notes

## picoRTOS v1.5.4
### What's new ?

picoRTOS is back ! Version 1.5.3 has seen the project being retired for professionnal use, so this
one is a brand new architecture that has been re-written from the ground up.

Unfortunately older users of picoRTOS on PowerPC and C2000 cannot update because despite similar
user interfaces, the port API has been fundamentally rewritten and is not compatible anymore.

Anyway, some features left us, but new features have been added, like "dynamic" priority assignment,
syscalls, queues and much more.

picoRTOS is now safer, faster and more complete, enjoy !
